# Workflow: 7D Methodology

All work must follow the **7D Alignment Gate**:

**Define → Design → Develop → Debug → Document → Deliver → Deploy**

## 1. Define
- Understand the mission.
- Identify the scope.
- Create/update the track plan.

## 2. Design
- Propose changes (Dry-run unified diff).
- Align with product guidelines.

## 3. Develop
- Implement the changes after approval.

## 4. Debug
- Verify the changes locally.
- Ensure no "red waves" or broken styles.

## 5. Document
- Update relevant docs (if any).
- Update track status.

## 6. Deliver
- Commit the changes.

## 7. Deploy
- Push to the repository.
